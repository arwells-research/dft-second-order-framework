## 1. Purpose

This document provides a **manifold-based construction** of the second-order
constraint space Σ₂.

The manifold construction is the **continuous counterpart** to the graph
construction and an intermediate abstraction between the canonical fiber-bundle
model and discrete graph reductions.

It is appropriate when:
- second-order organization varies continuously,
- qualitative regimes are separated by instability boundaries,
- differential structure is useful for analysis or simulation.

This construction is a **representation**, not an ontological claim that Σ₂ “is”
a manifold.

---

## 2. Core idea

Σ₂ is represented as a **topological manifold (possibly stratified)** whose
points correspond to **organizational modes**, not instantaneous states.

Trajectories in Σ₂ represent **continuous deformation of organization**, not
motion through physical space.

---

## 3. Manifold structure

### Definition (Organizational manifold)

Let Σ₂ be a topological space equipped with an atlas of charts such that:

- each chart covers a region of qualitatively similar organization,
- coordinate values parameterize organizational degrees of freedom,
- chart overlap preserves admissibility relations.

Coordinates have **no intrinsic physical meaning**.

---

## 4. Stratification

Σ₂ is generally not smooth everywhere.

### Definition (Stratified structure)

Σ₂ is a **stratified manifold**:

    Σ₂ = ⋃ₖ Sₖ

where:
- each stratum Sₖ is a smooth manifold,
- strata differ in dimensionality,
- boundaries between strata represent qualitative transitions.

Examples of transitions include:
- onset or loss of stability,
- bifurcation of organization,
- emergence or collapse of gating.

---

## 5. Space-like analog

The manifold provides a **space-like analog** via:

- neighborhoods (local compatibility),
- boundaries (organizational limits),
- separation (incompatibility),
- connected components (distinct regimes).

No metric is required.

If a metric is introduced, it must be:
- derived,
- embodiment-dependent,
- non-fundamental.

---

## 6. Time-like analog

The **time-like analog** arises from curves on Σ₂.

### Definition (Second-order evolution)

A second-order evolution is a continuous curve:

    σ : I → Σ₂

where I is an abstract parameter indexing transformation order, not clock time.

Properties:
- directionality reflects irreversibility,
- parametrization is not unique,
- ordering matters, duration does not.

---

## 7. Vector fields and flows (optional structure)

When appropriate, one may define:

- vector fields on strata,
- piecewise-smooth flows,
- stochastic perturbations.

These structures represent:
- tendencies of organizational change,
- constraint-induced drift,
- noise-sensitive evolution.

They must not be interpreted as physical forces.

---

## 8. Holonomy in the manifold

### Definition (Manifold holonomy)

Holonomy arises when:

- a closed loop in first-order configuration space
- induces a nontrivial loop or displacement in Σ₂.

Equivalently:
- returning to the same first-order state,
- while occupying a different point in Σ₂.

This reflects **path dependence** without stored memory.

---

## 9. Capacity without storage

In the manifold construction, capacity is characterized by:

- dimensionality of strata,
- number and structure of attractor basins,
- curvature or torsion (if defined),
- robustness of flows under perturbation.

Capacity is organizational, not representational.

---

## 10. Relation to the fiber bundle model

The manifold model can be obtained from the fiber bundle model by:

- treating fibers as smooth spaces,
- focusing on intrinsic organization variables,
- suppressing explicit reference to the base space.

Conversely, the manifold may be re-embedded as fibers over first-order space.

---

## 11. Relation to the graph model

The graph model arises from the manifold model by:

- discretizing strata into regions,
- collapsing regions into nodes,
- encoding boundary crossings as edges.

Thus:

    fiber bundle → stratified manifold → graph

---

## 12. Prohibited interpretations

This manifold must not be interpreted as:

- a physical space,
- a hidden dimension of spacetime,
- a container of latent forms,
- a memory substrate.

Points on the manifold are **organizational descriptors**, not stored entities.

---

## 13. Status

This manifold construction is a valid representation of Σ₂
when continuous variation of organization is relevant.

Any use of this model must:

- justify smoothness assumptions,
- preserve trajectory primacy,
- avoid metric reification.

Compatibility requires adherence to these constraints.
