# Mapping Molecular Phenomena to Σ₂

**Document role:** Interpretive mapping (non-axiomatic)  
**Status:** Stable (may be extended with additional examples)  
**Depends on:**  
- 01_PRIMITIVES_AND_AXIOMS.md  
- 02_ORDERS_OF_ORGANIZATION.md  
- 03_SECOND_ORDER_SPACE_SIGMA2.md

## 1. Purpose

This document maps **well-established molecular phenomena** onto the Σ₂ framework
to demonstrate that second-order organization:

- is already implicit in known chemistry and biophysics,
- does not require new physics,
- and unifies disparate phenomena under a single organizational principle.

The goal is **unification**, not reinterpretation of empirical results.

---

## 2. Unifying principle (restated)

All mapped phenomena instantiate the same underlying mechanism:

> **Persistent relational constraints transduce first-order interactions into a
restricted, repeatable geometry of admissible trajectories.**

In Σ₂ terms:
- constraints reduce dimensionality,
- admissibility geometry emerges,
- ordering of transformations becomes causally relevant.

---

## 3. Canonical mapping template

For each phenomenon, we identify:

- **X** — first-order configuration variables  
- **σ (Sigma₂ fiber variable)** — organizational mode  
- **Constraints** — what stabilizes σ  
- **Order relevance** — where noncommutativity / holonomy appears  

This keeps the mapping disciplined and non-metaphorical.

## 4. Vibrational / rotational / electronic resonance

### Description (standard science)
Molecules exhibit discrete collective modes that absorb energy selectively
(IR, microwave, UV–vis spectroscopy).

---

### Σ₂ mapping
- **X:** instantaneous nuclear coordinates and electronic populations  
- **σ:** active collective mode (normal-mode occupancy / phase relation)  
- **Constraints:** bonding geometry couples atomic DOFs into global modes  

---

### Order relevance
- Energy input sequence matters (mode locking, anharmonic coupling).
- Structured inputs are selectively amplified rather than dissipated.

This is **dimensional reduction of admissible motion**, not mere energy storage.

---

## 5. Conformational landscapes and hysteresis

### Description
Molecules (especially proteins) occupy metastable basins connected by pathways
with barriers and path-dependent switching.

---

### Σ₂ mapping
- **X:** detailed atomic configuration  
- **σ:** basin identity / conformational regime  
- **Constraints:** sterics, bonding, solvent coupling  

---

### Order relevance
- Identical configurations can differ in future evolution depending on path.
- Basin transitions exhibit hysteresis and memory-like effects.

This is **holonomy in basin space**.

---

## 6. Allostery (sequence-dependent response)

### Description
Binding or modification at one site alters response at another, depending on
the order of events.

---

### Σ₂ mapping
- **X:** instantaneous molecular structure  
- **σ:** coordination pattern linking distant sites  
- **Constraints:** mechanical coupling across the molecule  

---

### Order relevance
Let τ₁ = binding at site A, τ₂ = binding at site B.

Both compositions are admissible, but:

    Outcome(τ₂ ∘ τ₁) ≠ Outcome(τ₁ ∘ τ₂)

This is explicit **noncommutativity of transformations**.

---

## 7. Chirality and handedness biases

### Description
Chiral molecules interact asymmetrically with fields, substrates, and reactions,
producing directional biases.

---

### Σ₂ mapping
- **X:** atomic arrangement  
- **σ:** handed organizational mode  
- **Constraints:** asymmetric bonding geometry  

---

### Order relevance
Chirality restricts admissible trajectory classes, breaking symmetry in
organizational space.

It is **trajectory selection**, not just static shape.

---

## 8. Molecular machines and motors

### Description
Systems like ATP synthase, kinesin, and ion pumps perform cyclic, gated work.

---

### Σ₂ mapping
- **X:** instantaneous mechanical and chemical state  
- **σ:** phase / winding variable of the cycle  
- **Constraints:** cyclic coupling of chemical and mechanical DOFs  

---

### Order relevance
- Work extraction is phase-localized.
- Useful power arises from completing cycles, not from instantaneous force.

Invariant quantity: **winding number**, not energy at an instant.

---

## 9. Coherence and delocalization effects

### Description
Certain molecular systems maintain phase coherence across sites, affecting
efficiency and dynamics.

---

### Σ₂ mapping
- **X:** local populations or amplitudes  
- **σ:** relational phase structure  
- **Constraints:** coupling topology and decoherence limits  

---

### Order relevance
Loss of coherence collapses admissibility geometry.
Maintained coherence stabilizes a σ that governs outcomes.

Again: **organization without storage**.

---

## 10. What all cases share (summary)

Across all examples:

- Constraints persist across time.
- Degrees of freedom are coupled.
- Admissible trajectories form a small subset of possibilities.
- Ordering of transformations matters.
- Holonomy appears without stored state.

These are exactly the defining features of Σ₂ relevance.

---

## 11. Classification outcome

All mapped phenomena qualify as:

> **Proto-second-order systems**  
> (nontrivial admissibility geometry without persistent σ stabilization).

They form the **continuous bridge** from first-order chemistry to full
second-order organization.

---

## 12. Why this mapping matters

This mapping shows that Σ₂:

- unifies known molecular phenomena,
- explains continuity from chemistry to biology,
- avoids invoking repositories or hidden fields,
- and provides a principled screen for candidate second-order systems.

No empirical claim is altered; only the organizational interpretation is unified.

---

## 13. Status

This document is interpretive and integrative.

It:
- introduces no new axioms,
- respects all constraints defined in 03_SECOND_ORDER_SPACE_SIGMA2.md,
- and provides a template for mapping additional phenomena.

Further extensions should follow the same mapping discipline.
