# Mapping Molecular Phenomena to Σ₂

**Document role:** Interpretive mapping / integrative taxonomy  
**Status:** Non-normative (must not introduce new axioms)  
**Scope:** Molecular and proto-organizational systems

---

## 1. Purpose

This document maps familiar molecular and mesoscale physical phenomena into
the Σ₂ framework defined in:

- 03_SECOND_ORDER_SPACE_SIGMA2.md
- 10_PROTO_SECOND_ORDER_SYSTEMS.md
- second_order_organization_admissible_trajectories.tex

The purpose is to:

- demonstrate that Σ₂ is not exotic,
- show how ordering relevance arises naturally under embodiment,
- and provide a structured vocabulary for diagnosing proto-second-order systems.

This is not a biological model and makes no claims about life as such.

---

## 2. Mapping principle

A phenomenon qualifies as Σ₂-relevant if:

- outcomes depend on ordering of interactions,
- viability depends on trajectory history,
- and this dependence is not eliminable by instantaneous-state closure under the
  embodiment constraints.

---

## 3. Summary table (high-level)

(See sections below for full mappings.)

- allosteric gating → admissible trajectory selectivity
- conformational hysteresis → proto-holonomy
- resonance bandwidth selection → gate geometry in phase
- cyclic molecular motors → phase-gated admissibility
- selective transport / ratchets → ordering relevance under dissipation

---

## 4. Allostery as admissible trajectory gating

Allosteric enzymes exhibit:

- multiple conformational regimes,
- binding events that depend on prior binding history,
- and sequence-dependent outcomes.

Within Σ₂:

- the admissibility predicate selects trajectories that enter binding-effective
  conformations for sufficient duration,
- and ordering relevance is induced by constraint-mediated coupling.

This is proto-second-order unless active cellular mechanisms stabilize conformer
availability against noise.

---

## 5. Hysteresis and conformational memory

Many molecules exhibit hysteresis loops:

- path-dependent transitions between conformers,
- distinct response curves under increasing vs decreasing drive.

Within Σ₂:

- hysteresis is proto-holonomy if loops alter future admissibility,
- but remains proto-second-order if effects wash out immediately after driving ceases.

---

## 6. Resonance as gate geometry

Resonance phenomena can be seen as:

- narrow regions of phase or frequency space where coupling becomes effective,
- outside which energy input fails to couple or is dissipated.

Within Σ₂:

- gating emerges as a geometric consequence of constrained interaction under embodiment,
  not as a new mechanism.

---

## 7. Molecular motors as phase-gated transduction

Molecular motors exhibit:

- cyclic action,
- phase-dependent work extraction,
- ordering dependence of binding, hydrolysis, and mechanical steps.

Within Σ₂:

- the “cycle” is a constrained trajectory class,
- and viability is determined by entering phase windows with sufficient temporal coherence.

Again, without active stabilization, these are proto-second-order.

---

## 8. Selective transport and ratchets

Transport systems can exhibit:

- directional motion in noisy environments,
- path-dependent gating and state-dependent barriers.

Within Σ₂:

- the admissibility predicate enforces directional viability only for specific
  trajectory classes.

---

## 9. Noncommutativity across interventions

Ordering relevance can be tested via interventions such as:

- applying a phase shift then an impulse,
- applying an impulse then a phase shift.

If outcomes differ robustly under admissible perturbations, Σ₂ order relevance is
operationally confirmed.

---

## 10. Classification outcome

All mapped phenomena qualify as:

> **Proto-second-order systems**  
> (nontrivial admissibility geometry without persistent σ stabilization).

They form a **continuous bridge** from first-order chemistry to **Σ₂-type organization motifs** (ordering relevance and trajectory-level admissibility geometry).

---

## 12. Why this mapping matters

This mapping shows that Σ₂:

- unifies known molecular phenomena,
- explains continuity from chemistry to **biological components and motifs** that exhibit ordering relevance,
- avoids invoking repositories or hidden fields,
- and provides a principled screen for candidate second-order systems.

**Scope note:** This mapping does **not** claim Σ₂ sufficiency for biological organization. In the current sigma-order program, organism-level biology is treated as requiring higher-order closure (provisionally Σ₅+).

No empirical claim is altered; only the organizational interpretation is unified.

---

## 13. Status

This document is interpretive and integrative.

It:
- introduces no new axioms,
- respects all constraints defined in 03_SECOND_ORDER_SPACE_SIGMA2.md,
- and provides a vocabulary for downstream case studies.

Any future revision must preserve the formal meaning of Σ₂ and must not introduce
domain-specific sufficiency claims.
