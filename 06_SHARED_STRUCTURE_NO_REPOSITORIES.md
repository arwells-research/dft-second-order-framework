# Shared Structure Without Repositories

**Document role:** Normative clarification of shared organization  
**Applies to:** All claims of shared structure, recurrence, convergence, or common patterns  
**Status:** Frozen at MAJOR version v0.x (extensions allowed via MINOR)

## 1. Purpose

This document resolves a recurring conceptual tension:

How can multiple systems exhibit *the same organization* without invoking
a shared repository, template, field, or stored form?

It formalizes how **shared structure arises from common constraints** rather than
from shared storage, memory, or transmission of abstract entities.

This document explicitly prohibits repository-based interpretations
while preserving explanatory power.

---

## 2. The problem statement

Empirically, we observe:

- repeated emergence of similar forms,
- convergent behaviors across independent systems,
- shared functional motifs,
- apparent “ideas” or patterns instantiated multiple times.

Naïve explanations posit:

- stored templates,
- morphogenetic fields as repositories,
- informational substrates detached from embodiment.

These explanations are **incompatible** with the axioms.

---

## 3. Core principle

### Principle (Constraint-Based Sharing)

Shared structure arises because **independent systems are constrained to select
from the same admissible space**, not because they access the same stored content.

There is no shared object.
There is only shared admissibility.

---

## 4. What “shared” means in this framework

### Definition (Shared structure)

Two or more instantiated trajectories are said to share structure if and only if:

- they occupy isomorphic regions of Σ₂,
- under equivalent embodiment constraints,
- despite being causally independent.

Sharing is structural, not transactional.

---

## 5. Σ₂ as a grammar, not a library

Σ₂ functions as:

- a grammar of what can persist,
- a rule set defining admissibility,
- a constraint geometry shaping outcomes.

Σ₂ does **not** function as:

- a database,
- a memory store,
- a template archive,
- a communication medium.

There is nothing “in” Σ₂ to retrieve.

---

## 6. First instantiation and non-recurrence

The framework explicitly allows for **first instantiation**:

- a trajectory may be realized for the first time,
- without any prior instance,
- without reference to recurrence.

The admissibility of a trajectory does not depend on how often it has occurred.

Recurrence stabilizes but does not originate structure.

---

## 7. Convergence without communication

### Proposition (Convergent instantiation)

If multiple systems:

- share compatible embodiment constraints,
- operate under similar environmental conditions,
- and draw from the same Σ₂,

then convergent instantiation of isomorphic trajectories is expected.

No communication, transmission, or storage is required.

---

## 8. Apparent fields and collective patterns

Phenomena often described as:

- morphogenetic fields,
- collective memories,
- shared idea spaces,

can be reinterpreted as:

- distributed enforcement of constraints,
- shared boundary conditions,
- synchronized selection within Σ₂.

These are **not** independent ontological entities.

---

## 9. What maintains shared constraint space

Σ₂ is maintained by:

- physical law,
- invariance requirements,
- embodiment constraints,
- viability conditions.

It is not maintained by:

- minds,
- fields,
- information storage,
- or collective intention.

Constraints persist because violations fail.

---

## 10. No latent population of forms

There is no population of uninstantiated forms “waiting” to be realized.

Before instantiation:

- there are no forms,
- only admissible relations.

Instantiation does not select a stored pattern;
it **stabilizes a trajectory**.

---

## 11. Implications for biology, mind, and AI

This framework implies:

- biological similarity arises from constraint geometry, not templates,
- instinct reflects stabilized second-order organization, not encoded ideas,
- shared cognitive motifs do not require collective minds,
- artificial systems may converge without shared training data if constraints match.

---

## 12. Prohibited interpretations

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- shared repositories of ideas or forms,
- morphogenetic fields as storage media,
- collective memory spaces detached from embodiment,
- nonlocal access to abstract patterns,
- disembodied informational substrates.

Any such interpretation violates foundational axioms.

---

## 13. Status

This document resolves all claims of shared structure within the framework.

Downstream work must:

- explain shared phenomena via constraints and admissibility,
- avoid repository metaphors,
- and explicitly reject storage-based explanations.

Compatibility requires adherence to these principles.
