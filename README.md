# Dual-Frame Theory: Second-Order Framework

**Status:** Foundational / Axiomatic (with operational grounding)  
**Version:** v0.2.0  
**Scope:** Conceptual kernel + minimal operational demonstration  
**Audience:** Researchers in theoretical biology, complex systems, dynamical systems, foundations of cognition, and foundational AI

---

## Purpose

This repository defines the foundational framework for **second-order organization** within Dual-Frame Theory (DFT).

It formalizes:

- what is meant by **first-, second-, and third-order organization**
- how second-order structure differs categorically from first-order spacetime dynamics
- how second-order constraint spaces (**Σ₂**) exist **without acting as repositories**
- how embodiment grounds second-order dynamics without mysticism or reductionism
- how admissible trajectories replace state-based sufficiency when ordering matters

In addition to the formal framework, this repository includes a **minimal operational grounding artifact** demonstrating that Σ₂ diagnostics are measurable and behave as predicted in a controlled stochastic system.

This repository is **not** an application, dataset, or domain-specific model. It exists to preserve **conceptual invariants** and **diagnostic criteria** so downstream work does not drift, collapse categories, or smuggle in hidden state.

---

## What this repository is

- A formal contract of **definitions, axioms, and prohibitions**
- A shared dependency for future theoretical and applied work
- A constraint layer that later models must satisfy
- A boundary-setting document (what is allowed vs. forbidden)
- A reference implementation demonstrating operational detectability of Σ₂ organization

---

## What this repository is not

- Not a biological model
- Not a neuroscience data analysis
- Not an AI architecture
- Not a metaphysical proposal
- Not a theory of consciousness per se
- Not a claim of new physical forces or energy sources

All applications, simulations, and empirical studies must live in **separate repositories** and explicitly reference this framework.

---

## Core commitments

This framework is built on the following non-negotiable commitments:

1. Process precedes state  
2. Organization is real and causally effective  
3. Constraints are real but not objects  
4. Second order is not refined first-order time  
5. No disembodied repositories of form, memory, or ideas  
6. Embodiment is required for causal efficacy  
7. Conservation laws are respected at the trajectory level  

Violating any of these invalidates compatibility.

---

## Structure of the framework

- **First order (S-frame):** state evolution indexed by parametric time
- **Second order (Σ₂ / T-frame):** admissible trajectory geometry with ordering relevance
- **Third order:** representation of second-order structure itself

Only first-order dynamics admit complete instantaneous-state closure.

## The paper

The theoretical framework is developed in:

**Second-Order Organization as Constraint Geometry Over Admissible Trajectories**

The paper includes:
- the formal definition of Σ₂
- the proto → true second-order boundary
- operational hallmarks (noncommutativity, holonomy, failed Markov closure)
- a minimal stochastic grounding example

---

## Build the paper

./make_paper.sh

Output:

## Versioning discipline

- **MAJOR** version changes break axioms or definitions
- **MINOR** versions add compatible structure or diagnostics
- **PATCH** versions clarify language only

Axioms may not be silently edited.
