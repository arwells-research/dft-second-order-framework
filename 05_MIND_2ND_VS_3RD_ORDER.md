# Second- and Third-Order Mind

**Document role:** Normative classification of cognitive organization  
**Applies to:** All uses of “mind,” “cognition,” “awareness,” and “representation”  
**Status:** Frozen at MAJOR version v0.x (extensions allowed via MINOR)

## 1. Purpose

This document formally distinguishes **second-order** and **third-order** mind
within the Dual-Frame second-order framework.

Its purpose is to:

- prevent conflation of reactivity with representation,
- prevent premature attribution of awareness or consciousness,
- clarify how cognition can exist without symbolic thought,
- specify the structural threshold at which representation arises.

This document does **not** attempt to define consciousness phenomenology.
It defines **organizational prerequisites** only.

---

## 2. What “mind” means in this framework

### Definition (Mind)

A system exhibits *mind* if and only if its behavior depends on internal
organizational variables that are not reducible to instantaneous state.

Mind is therefore an **organizational property**, not a substance or essence.

---

## 3. Second-order mind

### 3.1 Definition

A system exhibits **second-order mind** if and only if:

1. Its behavior depends on second-order variables (φ),
2. Those variables encode trajectory-dependent organization,
3. The system does **not** represent those variables as objects.

Second-order mind operates *within* Σ₂ but does not model Σ₂.

---

### 3.2 Core characteristics

Second-order mind exhibits:

- trajectory selection via attractors,
- phase- or timing-based gating,
- conditional action dependent on past path,
- memory as persistence of organization,
- robustness through cyclic organization.

Second-order mind is **reactive and adaptive**, but not reflective.

---

### 3.3 What second-order mind is not

Second-order mind does **not** include:

- explicit symbols,
- abstract concepts,
- internal models of itself,
- deliberate planning over imagined futures,
- awareness of its own organizational structure.

Any such features indicate higher order.

---

## 4. Spatiality and awareness at second order

Second-order organization may have **space-like structure** (Σ₂),
but this structure is not experienced as space.

There is no internal viewpoint, map, or navigation.

Second-order “awareness” (if the term is used at all) is:

- immediate,
- situated,
- non-reflective,
- inseparable from action.

---

## 5. Third-order mind

### 5.1 Definition

A system exhibits **third-order mind** if and only if:

1. It contains second-order organization, and
2. It represents elements of that organization as manipulable objects.

Third order is **representation of representation**.

---

### 5.2 Core characteristics

Third-order mind exhibits:

- internal modeling of trajectories or attractors,
- explicit representation of organizational alternatives,
- deliberation over non-immediate possibilities,
- decoupling from direct environmental drive,
- symbolic or quasi-symbolic manipulation.

Third-order mind can reason *about* its own organization.

---

### 5.3 Emergent spatiality of thought

The familiar experience of ideas as:

- arranged,
- proximate or distant,
- navigable,
- structured in “conceptual space”

arises **only** at third order.

This spatiality is an artifact of representing Σ₂,
not a property of Σ₂ itself.

---

## 6. Transition from second to third order

### 6.1 Structural threshold

The transition occurs when:

- second-order variables become objects of internal reference,
- trajectories are compared, selected, or simulated,
- organization itself becomes a subject of control.

This transition is **discrete**, not gradual.

---

### 6.2 Requirements for transition

The transition requires:

- sufficient stability of second-order organization,
- representational resources,
- additional energy and structural overhead,
- a mechanism for internal reference.

Not all second-order systems can transition.

---

## 7. Mixed-order cognition

Real systems may contain:

- second-order subsystems operating without representation,
- third-order subsystems operating over selected domains.

Order classification applies to **functional requirements**, not global labels.

---

## 8. Prohibited conflations

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- treating all cognition as third order,
- attributing reflective awareness to second-order systems,
- collapsing instinct or reactivity into “primitive consciousness,”
- projecting human introspection onto second-order organization.

Such conflations undermine explanatory clarity.

---

## 9. Relation to biology and AI

This framework allows:

- biological systems to possess second-order mind without third order,
- artificial systems to possess second-order mind without symbolic AI,
- third-order mind to arise only when representational thresholds are crossed.

No biological substrate is privileged.

---

## 10. Status

The distinction between second- and third-order mind is foundational.

Any downstream work involving cognition or intelligence must:

- specify which order is invoked,
- justify the classification structurally,
- avoid implicit promotion of order.

Violations constitute incompatibility with this framework.
