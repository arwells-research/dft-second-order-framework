# Second- and Third-Order Mind

**Document role:** ARCHIVAL (superseded)  
**Applies to:** Historical internal terminology usage only  
**Status:** Archived — not part of the current Σ₂ foundational contract

**Audit note (2026):** Subsequent development of the sigma-order program places **organism-level biology** at higher sigma orders (provisionally **Σ₅+**) and treats **cognition / reflective awareness** as higher still. The Σ₂ repository defines *trajectory-level admissibility geometry*; it does not certify cognitive-order classifications.

This document is retained for provenance only. It should not be used as a normative reference for current work without an explicit, newer, higher-order cognition framework.

## 1. Purpose

This document formally distinguishes **second-order** and **third-order** mind
within the Dual-Frame second-order framework.

The purpose is to prevent a common error:

- treating all organization as either “reflex” or “symbolic cognition.”

Second-order mind is defined as **enacted organization under Σ₂ constraint geometry**,
where ordering relevance and admissible trajectories govern responsiveness and
stabilization.

Third-order mind is defined as the emergence of **representational access to Σ₂
structure itself**.

The third-order distinction is introduced only to make second-order mind precise.
This is not a theory of consciousness.

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Mind

A system has mind (in this framework) if it exhibits:

- nontrivial admissibility geometry,
- order relevance of interaction,
- enacted maintenance of organizational viability,
- and nontrivial selection over trajectories under embodiment.

Mind is not defined as introspection, language, or subjective report.

---

### 2.2 Second-order mind

A system has second-order mind if:

- it exhibits Σ₂ organization,
- its behavior depends on admissible trajectories,
- and it enacts stabilizing constraints that preserve organizational viability.

Second-order mind is **enactive** and **embodied**.

It can include rich responsiveness without representation.

---

### 2.3 Third-order mind

A system has third-order mind if it:

- constructs a representation of its own Σ₂ organization,
- can reason over admissibility structure,
- and can deliberately modify or communicate that structure.

Third-order mind introduces representational awareness *of* second-order organization.

This is a categorical shift.

---

## 3. What second order is not

Second-order mind is not:

- symbolic reasoning,
- stored semantic representations,
- propositional knowledge,
- internal “models” detached from embodiment.

It can be sophisticated without being reflective.

---

## 4. Hallmarks of second-order mind

Second-order mind exhibits:

- ordering relevance (noncommutativity),
- viable trajectory constraints,
- context-sensitive gating,
- stabilization of organizational coordinates under perturbation.

Second-order mind is fundamentally *trajectory-based*.

---

## 5. Hallmarks of third-order mind

Third-order mind exhibits:

- explicit representational access to organizational constraints,
- counterfactual reasoning over admissibility,
- deliberate modification of its own constraint geometry,
- communicability of organizational structure (in some substrate-specific form).

Third order is not required for rich behavior.

---

## 6. Common confusions

The following are explicitly forbidden:

- treating all cognition as third order,
- attributing reflective awareness to second-order systems,
- collapsing instinct or reactivity into “primitive consciousness,”
- projecting human introspection onto second-order organization.

Such conflations undermine explanatory clarity.

---

## 7. Why this distinction matters

This classification prevents a false dichotomy between:

- “mechanism-only” accounts, and
- “symbolic mind” accounts.

Second-order mind names a middle regime:

- enacted, embodied organization that is not symbolic,
- but is also not reducible to first-order dynamics.

---

## 8. Relation to Σ₂ axioms

Second-order mind is compatible with:

- no repositories,
- embodiment grounding,
- trajectory-level conservation,
- admissible trajectories as primary objects.

Third-order mind adds representation but does not violate these commitments.

---

## 9. Relation to biology and AI

This framework allows:

- biological systems to possess second-order mind without third order,
- artificial systems to possess second-order mind without symbolic AI,
- third-order mind to arise only when representational thresholds are crossed.

No biological substrate is privileged.

---

## 10. Status

The distinction between second- and third-order mind is intended to remain stable
within the broader DFT program.

However, extensions are expected, especially in:

- thresholds for representation,
- decomposition of third-order mind into subtypes,
- operational diagnostics for third order.

All extensions must preserve the commitments of the second-order framework.
