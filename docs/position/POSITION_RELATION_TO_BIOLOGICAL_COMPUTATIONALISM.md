# Position Note: Relation to Biological Computationalism

## Status and Scope

This document is **not part of the Σ₂ formalism**.  
It exists to clarify points of contact and distinction between **second-order organizational geometry (Σ₂)** and recent theoretical positions often referred to as **biological computationalism**.

The term biological computationalism is used here to denote a recently articulated theoretical stance (e.g., Milinković & Aru, *On biological and artificial consciousness: A case for biological computationalism*), rather than an established or standardized scientific field. Nothing in Σ₂ depends on biological computationalism, nor does Σ₂ assert claims about consciousness, cognition, or biological exclusivity. This note is interpretive and comparative, intended to prevent category errors and to support cross-framework dialogue.

## Biological Computationalism (Position Summary)

Biological computationalism argues that computation in biological systems—particularly nervous systems—cannot be adequately described as abstract, substrate-independent symbol manipulation. Instead, it emphasizes that biological computation is:

- inseparable from underlying physical dynamics,
- hybrid in nature (continuous–discrete),
- metabolically and energetically grounded,
- scale-inseparable (no clean software/hardware split).

The position rejects classical computational functionalism as a sufficient account of biological intelligence or consciousness, while remaining open to the possibility that non-biological systems could instantiate similar forms of embodied computation.

At its core, biological computationalism is a claim about **what kind of computation biological systems perform** and what constraints such computation must satisfy.

## Σ₂ (Second-Order Organization) Summary

Σ₂ formalizes organization in terms of:

- **admissible trajectories** rather than instantaneous states,
- **embodiment-indexed constraints** on system evolution,
- **order relevance** (noncommutativity of transformations),
- **holonomy-like effects** (“memory without representation”),
- a sharp **proto → true** organizational boundary based on active maintenance of admissibility.

Σ₂ is deliberately agnostic with respect to:
- biological substrate,
- computational interpretation,
- consciousness or phenomenology.

It addresses a different structural question:

> **When does a system require trajectory-level description, independent of whether its dynamics admit a computational interpretation?**

## Points of Alignment

Σ₂ and biological computationalism converge on several foundational insights.

### 1. Limits of state-based descriptions  
Both frameworks identify intrinsic limits of purely state-based, Markovian, or symbol-level models for embodied systems whose behavior depends on history and temporal structure.

### 2. Constitutive role of energetics and dissipation  
Biological computationalism emphasizes metabolic grounding of computation; Σ₂ shows how dissipation actively **selects**, **filters**, and **sharpens** admissible trajectories and their gating regions.

### 3. Non-representational persistence  
Both reject classical notions of stored internal representations as the primary basis of memory:
- biological computationalism via physical, embodied computation,
- Σ₂ via order-dependent admissibility and holonomy-like effects.

## Key Distinctions

Despite these resonances, the two frameworks differ in scope and formal commitments.

### 1. Computation versus organization  
Biological computationalism is a theory of **computation in biological systems**.  
Σ₂ is a theory of **organization** applicable to any embodied dynamical system, whether or not it is naturally described as computational.

A system may instantiate second-order organization without performing computation in any conventional sense.

### 2. Absence of admissibility geometry in biological computationalism  
Biological computationalism does not formalize:
- admissible versus inadmissible trajectories,
- the geometry of trajectory space,
- operational diagnostics for order relevance.

Σ₂ explicitly provides:
- the admissibility predicate `Adm(γ; E)`,
- noncommutativity tests,
- criteria for failed Markov closure.

### 3. Proto versus true organizational threshold  
Σ₂ introduces a sharp distinction between:
- **proto-second-order systems** (transient ordering without self-maintenance),
- **true second-order systems** (active preservation of admissibility geometry).

This boundary is not articulated within biological computationalism, but is central for questions concerning autonomy, minimal organization, and origins.

## Complementarity (Not Competition)

The relationship between the two can be summarized cleanly:

> **Biological computationalism can supply rich embodiments \(E\);  
> Σ₂ supplies the diagnostic geometry that determines whether those embodiments instantiate second-order organization.**

In this sense:
- biological computationalism motivates *why* trajectory-level reasoning is often required in biological systems,
- Σ₂ specifies *when* and *how* trajectory-level organization becomes unavoidable, in biological or non-biological systems alike.

Σ₂ may therefore function as a **structural substrate** beneath theories of biological computation, cognition, or consciousness, without inheriting their domain-specific commitments.

## Consciousness and Higher Orders

Biological computationalism explicitly addresses consciousness.  
Σ₂ deliberately does not.

Σ₂ characterizes **second-order organization**, not experience. Any account of consciousness would require additional structure—likely involving constraints acting on the geometry of admissibility itself (a potential “third-order” extension). This document makes no claims about such extensions.

---

## Practical Implications

Relative to biological computationalism, Σ₂ contributes primarily **diagnostic structure**:

- identifying when state-based or augmented-state models are fundamentally insufficient,
- distinguishing transient ordering from actively maintained organization,
- clarifying when apparent “memory” is geometric rather than representational.

These diagnostics are applicable across biology, chemistry, engineered systems, and artificial substrates, independent of debates about consciousness.

---

## Closing Remark

Σ₂ should be read neither as a rival to nor an extension of biological computationalism, but as an **orthogonal structural framework** that clarifies the geometry of organization underlying many systems biological computationalism seeks to describe.

This position note exists to make that relationship explicit—and to keep conceptual boundaries clean.
