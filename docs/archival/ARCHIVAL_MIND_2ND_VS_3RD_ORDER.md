## 1. Why this document is superseded

Earlier internal drafts of the Σ₂ framework used the phrases “second-order mind” and
“third-order mind” as informal shorthand for structural relationships between:

- trajectory-conditioned organization (Σ₂ motifs), and
- representational access to that organization.

Subsequent development of the sigma-order program clarifies that:

- organism-level biology requires higher-order closure (provisionally **Σ₅+**), and
- cognition / reflective awareness are treated as higher still.

Therefore, any cognition taxonomy anchored at Σ₂/Σ₃ is structurally underpowered and
risks category error.

This repository defines **Σ₂** only. It does not certify any theory of mind or cognition.

## 2. What (if anything) remains usable

Only the following very limited statement remains compatible with the current program:

> Systems can exhibit Σ₂-type ordering relevance and admissibility geometry without
> representation, and representation introduces additional structural requirements
> beyond Σ₂.

No other claims in the earlier “mind orders” framing should be used.

## 3. Replacement guidance

- For Σ₂ scope and limits, use: `SIGMA_ORDER_SCOPE_CORRECTION_2026.md`
- For any future cognition framework, wait for a dedicated higher-order repository
  (Σₖ with k≫3) that explicitly defines cognitive closure and its diagnostics.

## 4. Provenance

This file is retained only to preserve historical continuity of naming and to prevent
rediscovery of the same category error.

It should not be cited as a normative reference.
