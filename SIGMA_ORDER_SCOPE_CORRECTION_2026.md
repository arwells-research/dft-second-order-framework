# Sigma-Order Scope Correction (2026)

**Applies to:** `dft-second-order-framework` (Σ₂ foundational layer)  
**Status:** Normative clarification (does not change axioms/definitions)  
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## 1. Purpose

This note records a **scope correction** arising from later development of the sigma-order program.

It exists to prevent a category error:

- treating **Σ₂ (second-order)** as sufficient to model **biological organization** or **cognition**.

This repository remains valid as a definition of **Σ₂**.  
What changes is the *interpretive placement* of biology and cognition in the larger sigma hierarchy.

---

## 2. What this repository defines (and certifies)

This repository defines **Σ₂** as:

- **constraint geometry over admissible trajectories**,
- with **ordering relevance** (noncommutativity, holonomy-like path effects),
- grounded by **embodiment** (noise, dissipation, coupling constraints, resource limits),
- with **operational diagnostics** and a minimal stochastic grounding toy.

It does **not** assert new physics, repositories, or disembodied organizational substrates.

---

## 3. What Σ₂ is not sufficient for

### 3.1 Biology (organism-level)

Subsequent program development clarifies that **organism-level biology** requires structural features beyond Σ₂, including (not exhaustively):

- persistent closure maintenance against perturbation,
- recursive stabilization of admissibility structure,
- multi-scale constraint coupling and repair,
- lineage-persistent organization and reproduction of constraints.

These are **higher-order closure properties**. In the current program, biology is treated as requiring higher sigma order (provisionally **Σ₅+**).

Σ₂ phenomena can occur inside biological systems (components, motifs, subsystems), but Σ₂ alone does not model *biological organization as such*.

### 3.2 Cognition / reflective awareness

Cognition and reflective awareness are treated as higher-order phenomena downstream of biological closure. This repository does not certify any cognitive-order taxonomy.

Any cognitive-language documents included here are **non-normative** unless explicitly labeled otherwise.

## 4. How to read biological, molecular, and AI mentions in this repo

Mentions of biology, molecular systems, neuroscience, AI, or cognition in this repository are:

- **illustrative**,
- intended as **component-level / motif-level** examples of Σ₂-type ordering relevance,
- and must not be read as sufficiency claims.

Where older language suggested “continuity from chemistry to biology,” the intended meaning is:

- continuity from chemistry to **biological components and motifs** that exhibit Σ₂-type phenomena,

not an assertion that Σ₂ captures organism-level biology.

---

## 5. Repository policy (effective immediately)

1. **Σ₂ remains foundational**: keep axioms/definitions stable; changes require explicit version discipline.
2. **No sufficiency claims**: do not state or imply that Σ₂ suffices for organism-level biology or cognition.
3. **Domain work lives elsewhere**: empirical studies, biological modeling, neuroscience, AI architectures, or cognition frameworks must live in separate repositories, referencing Σ₂ only as a lower-layer contract.
4. **Archival handling**: documents that attempted to classify cognition within Σ₂/Σ₃ without the later sigma hierarchy should be marked **ARCHIVAL (superseded)**.

---

## 6. What does not change

- The Σ₂ formalism
- the admissibility definition
- the diagnostic criteria (ordering relevance, holonomy, failed Markov closure)
- the toy operational grounding artifacts

This note is a scope correction, not a revision of the Σ₂ layer.
