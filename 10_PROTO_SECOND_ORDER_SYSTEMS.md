## 1. Purpose

This document defines **proto-second-order systems** as a distinct and necessary
class in the hierarchy of organization.

The goal is to:

- prevent over-attribution of “second order” to all complex systems,
- explain why molecules and molecular machines are *almost* but not fully second order,
- clarify what *additional structure* is required for true second-order organization.

This classification preserves continuity without collapsing distinctions.

## 2. Motivation: why a proto-category is necessary

Without an intermediate category, one is forced into a false dichotomy:

- either molecules are “just first order,” or  
- molecules are already “second order.”

Both positions are wrong.

Molecular systems already exhibit:
- nontrivial admissibility geometry,
- noncommutativity of transformations,
- holonomy-like effects.

Yet they generally lack:
- persistent stabilization of organizational modes,
- self-maintenance of σ against noise,
- endogenous control over admissibility geometry.

A proto-second-order category resolves this.

## 3. Definition (Proto-second-order system)

A **proto-second-order system** is a system that:

1. Exhibits **nontrivial admissibility geometry**  
   (Σ₂(E) is nontrivial; not all trajectories are admissible)

2. Exhibits **noncommutativity of transformations**  
   (ordering of admissible processes affects outcomes)

3. May exhibit **holonomy under closed trajectories**

but:

4. **Does not persistently stabilize** an organizational mode σ  
   (σ is transient and easily erased by perturbations)

5. **Does not adapt** its admissibility geometry based on history

Proto-second-order systems sit strictly between first and second order.

Proto-second-order systems may transiently occupy second-order–like organizational modes, but lack mechanisms for maintaining or repairing them.

---

## 4. Contrast with first-order systems

A purely first-order system:

- can be fully characterized by instantaneous state variables,
- exhibits commutative or reducible transformations,
- erases history rapidly,
- has trivial or degenerate Σ₂(E).

First-order systems may be complex, but they lack trajectory-level organization.

---

## 5. Contrast with second-order systems

A true second-order system:

- persistently stabilizes σ as an organizational variable,
- maintains σ against noise and perturbation,
- exhibits robust holonomy across cycles,
- can modify its admissibility geometry through its own activity.

Second-order systems **live in Σ₂**, not merely touch it.

## 6. Molecular systems as canonical proto-second-order cases

### 6.1 Individual molecules

Molecules:
- impose persistent relational constraints,
- reduce admissible motion to structured modes,
- selectively transduce structured interactions.

However:
- σ (mode, basin, coordination pattern) is not self-maintaining,
- thermal noise and environment dominate long-term behavior.

Thus: proto-second-order.

---

### 6.2 Molecular machines

Molecular motors and pumps:
- exhibit cyclic organization,
- gate energy release by phase,
- show winding-number invariants.

Yet:
- cycles are driven externally,
- loss of gradients halts organization,
- σ collapses without continuous input.

Still proto-second-order.

---

## 7. Networks of proto-second-order systems

Coupled proto-second-order systems can produce:

- extended path dependence,
- metastable organizational regimes,
- partial σ persistence.

However, unless the network:
- actively maintains σ,
- repairs constraint degradation,
- regulates its own admissibility geometry,

it remains proto-second-order at the collective level.

This explains why **life requires networks**, not single molecules.

---

## 8. Threshold conditions for second-order emergence

Transition from proto-second-order → second-order requires:

1. **σ stabilization**  
   Organizational modes persist longer than characteristic noise timescales.

2. **Endogenous maintenance**  
   The system expends energy to preserve σ.

3. **Constraint feedback**  
   Organizational outcomes influence future admissibility.

4. **Closed organizational loops**  
   Maintenance processes are themselves admissible trajectories.

These conditions are structural, not substrate-specific.

---

## 9. Why proto-second-order systems matter

Proto-second-order systems:

- explain continuity from chemistry to biology,
- show how Σ₂ relevance can arise without life,
- provide design targets for artificial systems,
- avoid mystifying the origin of organization.

They are not “failed” second-order systems;
they are **necessary precursors**.

---

## 10. Relation to embodiment E

Proto-second-order behavior is highly sensitive to embodiment:

- small changes in noise or coupling can destroy σ,
- viability windows are narrow,
- admissibility geometry is fragile.

This fragility distinguishes proto-second-order systems
from robust second-order ones.

## 12. Status

This document establishes proto-second-order systems as a **necessary and distinct**
organizational category.

It:
- preserves sharp distinctions between orders,
- explains molecular organization without overreach,
- and prepares the ground for analyzing biological and cognitive systems.

Downstream work should explicitly classify candidate systems using this taxonomy.
