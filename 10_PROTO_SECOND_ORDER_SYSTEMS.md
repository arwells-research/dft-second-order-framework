# Proto-Second-Order Systems

**Document role:** Diagnostic classification  
**Status:** Non-normative (must not introduce new axioms)  
**Applies to:** Systems exhibiting ordering relevance without sustained σ maintenance

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **proto-second-order systems**.

Proto-second-order systems exhibit:

- nontrivial admissibility geometry,
- ordering relevance of interactions,
- and sometimes holonomy-like path effects,

but do **not** exhibit sustained stabilization of organizational coordinates (σ)
against perturbation.

They are structurally distinct from:

- first-order systems (state-sufficient closure),
- and true second-order organization (σ maintained and stabilized).

---

## 2. Definition

A system is proto-second-order if:

1. trajectories are subject to nontrivial admissibility constraints,
2. ordering matters for outcomes (noncommutativity),
3. admissible trajectory sets vary under perturbation,
4. but σ is not actively maintained as an organizational mode.

---

## 3. Operational hallmarks

Proto-second-order systems often exhibit:

- transient gating,
- hysteresis-like effects,
- phase-localized coupling,
- ordering-dependent responses,
- path-selective viability.

These can be operationally measured using Σ₂ diagnostics.

## 4. Proto vs. true second order

A system becomes true second-order when:

1. σ persists longer than passive decay times,
2. energy/resources are expended to stabilize σ,
3. stabilization feeds back to preserve admissibility structure,
4. maintenance trajectories are themselves admissible only because the organization exists.

These conditions are structural, not substrate-specific.

## 9. Why proto-second-order systems matter

Proto-second-order systems:

- explain continuity from chemistry to **biological components and motifs** that exhibit Σ₂-type ordering relevance,
- show how Σ₂ relevance can arise without life,
- provide design targets for artificial systems,
- avoid mystifying the origin of organization.

**Scope note:** Proto-second-order phenomena can appear in biological systems, but this does **not** imply Σ₂ sufficiency for biological organization. In the current sigma-order program, organism-level biology is treated as requiring higher-order closure (provisionally Σ₅+).

They are not “failed” second-order systems;
they are **necessary precursors**.

## 10. Relation to embodiment E

Proto-second-order behavior is highly sensitive to embodiment:

- small changes in noise or coupling can destroy σ,
- viability conditions can shift dramatically with dissipation,
- admissible trajectories may vanish under minor perturbations.

This sensitivity is a key reason Σ₂ must be indexed by embodiment.

## 11. Status

This document is a classification aid.

It does not modify:

- Σ₂ axioms,
- admissibility definitions,
- or diagnostic commitments.

Revisions must not introduce substrate-specific sufficiency claims.
